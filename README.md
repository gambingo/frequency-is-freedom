# Frequency is Freedom


### Development

1. This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies. You can find instructions for installing the latest Poetry [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation). Install all needed packages with:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

1. If you would like to work with jupyter notebooks while using poetry, after running `poetry install`, run:
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m ipykernel install --user --name frequency-is-freedom
   poetry run jupyter lab
   ```
   And then select the newly created kernel, `frequency-is-freedom`.# frequency-is-freedom
