    "Frequency is Freedom": [
        """
“Frequency is freedom” is a phrase coined by the urban planner Jarrett Walker that I learned about from the excellent book [Better Buses Better Cities](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44451608-better-buses-better-cities), and it has helped me articulate why I felt I have had a greater sense of freedom when I have lived and traveled abroad. Frequent transit service allowed me to go more places, to go places whenever I wanted to, and to still go places even when I was running late or forgot something. Because I spent less time waiting, frequent transit service allowed me to get moving sooner and to move faster once I was on the go.

I miss those freedoms, but I used to have those same freedoms here at home in Chicago. When ridership vanished at the beginning of the pandemic the CTA was forced to cut service [citation needed]. These days, buses and trains are still running less often as the CTA struggles to hire enough bus drivers [citation needed]. My own commute takes twice as long as it used to, which makes going into the office more of pain. I miss the community of the office, but when I do make the trek I find it mostly empty, because my coworker also all hate waiting forever for the bus or train [citation needed, commute data].

    "How Often Does the Bus Come?": [
        """
Like nearly all transit agencies, the CTA publishes scheduled and realtime service data. While anyone who lives in the city knows that the bus never runs on schedule, we can look at this data to see the service the CTA intends to run. Below is scheduled weekday service from the week of August 15th for two bus stops near my apartment. (I’ve filtered this data to only show service between 6 am and 10 pm, but the CTA does run buses and trains all night on many routes, including the 66 bus shown here.)

    "How Often Does the Bus Come? (part two)": [
        """
These numbers feel high to me. As expected, both buses have peaks around rush hour, but an average of 9 buses per hour for the 66 bus, which runs down Chicago Ave, feels high to me. That’s one bus nearly every 6 and half minutes. I wish the bus ran that often, because how often the bus comes determines how long I’m stuck waiting for it.

    "How Long Do You Wait For The Bus?": [
        """
There are may things in the world of transportation that are counterintuitive, one of them being how long you wait for the bus. If a bus arrives on average every ten minutes, you would be forgiven for thinking that the average time some spends waiting for the bus is half that, only five minutes. This would be the case is the bus arrived exactly every ten minutes, like clockwork, but it doesn’t. It arrives _on average_ every ten minutes, sometime sooner and sometimes later. And, sadly and surprisingly, the average time someone spends waiting for a bus like that is ten minutes.¹""",
        """
To understand why, think about a university that advertises small class. Tallying each class, the average may indeed be small, say thirty students. But not every class is that small. A few big freshman seminars may have hundreds of students. And since more students take those larger classes, when we tally students, their average number of students in their classes will be much higher.²
        """,
        """
When choosing a student at random, you are more likely to get a student in a larger class. When a bus arrives at a certain frequency – sometimes shorter, sometimes longer – you are more likely to arrive at the stop during a longer period. This same paradox explains why [your friends have more friends than you](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-inspection-paradox-is-everywhere-2ef1c2e9d709#070e).
